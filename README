mp3sort
-------
This is a utility to sort mp3s based on their ID3 tag into directories.
By default it will sort all mp3s it finds in the current working
directory and its subdirectory and move it to a <Artist>/<Album>
hierarchy, but this can be overwritten with the --template option.

Documentation
-------------
The script contains documentation in POD format.
Use, for example, pod2man to extract it as a manpage:

pod2man mp3sort.pl|nroff -man|less
